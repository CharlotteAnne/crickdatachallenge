## Code of conduct

The Crick Data Challenge is a very special environment as it brings together people from a wide range of backgrounds to work on a common problem. The event is a more enriching experience for everyone when we try to be open and receptive to others. It is helpful to get to know your team mates! Where do they work and who do they work for? Are they a biologist or a computer scientist or a mathematician (etc) by training? The groups will be heterogeneous both in biological and programming knowledge, this is an opportunity to learn from each other. Be patient with your team mates and respect their opinions, experience and skills.

The Crick Data Challenge, similarly to the Francis Crick Institute, is 100% dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Hackathon participants violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the discretion of the organizers. 

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination (related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion).
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following 
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

**Enforcement**

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event and/or future events.
Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules throughout the entire time of the Data Challenge. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

**Reporting**

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place.

If you are happy to be identified then the first port of call is to message either Martin Jones or Charlotte Capitanchik on our Slack workspace. We will be happy to speak to you in more detail.

If you prefer you can make an anonymous or personal report at any time using the form [here](https://crickdatachallenge.wufoo.com/forms/z12wb63z02t81d1/).
We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.


This code of conduct is based on the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.
