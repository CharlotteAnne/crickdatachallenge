## Code of conduct

Crick Data Chakkenge is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Hackathon participants violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the discretion of the conference organizers. 

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
*Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination (related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion).
*Sexual images in public spaces
*Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following 
*Harassing photography or recording
*Sustained disruption of talks or other events
*Inappropriate physical contact
*Unwelcome sexual attention
*Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

_Enforcement_
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.
Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!
